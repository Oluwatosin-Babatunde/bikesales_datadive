## Loading and Summarizing the Data:

First, I loaded the CSV data into a tibble called `bikes`.

```{r}
bikes <- read_csv("bike_data.csv")
```

Then, I used the `skim()` function to summarize the numeric and categorical variables:

```{r}
skim(bikes)
```

## The key insights from the skim:

-   Most numeric variables like Income has a right-skewed distribution instead of normal distribution.
-   The group that purchased bikes tends to have higher income.
-   Age is approximately normal distributed with mean 48 years old.

## A numeric summary - Gender and Number of Children:

```{r}
bikes %>%
  mutate(Children = as.numeric(Children)) %>%
  reframe(
    gender_n = n_distinct(Gender),
    gender_counts = table(Gender),
    children_n = n_distinct(Children),
    children_total = sum(Children)
  )
```

This shows the counts for the two categorical variables.

**Data Documentation Insights**

-   The data tracks customer demographics (age, income, number of children, education level etc) along with bike purchase history. This suggests the goal is to understand the target customer base.

-   It includes detailed segmentation data - region, commute distance ranges, and occupation categories. This indicates a desire to precisely understand behavioral differences in subgroups.

-   Unique IDs are provided for each customer, which shows the data could be appended or merged with additional customer data from other systems, like service history or web analytics.

-   No direct marketing costs or channel details are included. To calculate ROI, connecting purchase events back to marketing touchpoints would be valuable.

**Project Goals**

-   The data documentation shows this data was collected to analyze bike purchasing decisions. We could look at how family status impacts likelihood to purchase.

-   As noted above, a core goal seems to be understanding the target customer base and aligning product offerings appropriately. Find actionable customer sub-segments.

-   Key differentiator variables like occupation and commute distance suggest a desire to tailor messaging and products to consumer needs. Support customization.

-   Inclusion of extensive demographics indicates potential interest in propensity modeling - predicting purchase probability per segment. Prioritize high-probability targets.

## Questions for Further Analysis:

Based on the initial overview, here are some questions to investigate further:

-   What factors predict whether someone purchases a bike? Income seems correlated but are there other predictors like occupation?

-   Does bike purchasing behavior differ by region? The data has customers in Europe, North America, and the Pacific.

-   Is age correlated with income level? Since age is approximately normally distributed, then we can investigate this.

## Using Aggregation to Summarize Data:

I used aggregation to find the average income by occupation:

```{r}
bikes %>%
  group_by(Occupation) %>%
  summarize(avg_income = mean(as.numeric(gsub("[$|,]", "", Income))))
```

The management occupation has the highest average income by a significant margin. Professionals and skilled manuals also have higher incomes on average.

## Visualizations:

First, I plotted income distribution by bike purchase:

```{r}
bikes %>% 
  mutate(Income = as.numeric(gsub("[$|,]", "", Income))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(Income, fill = `Purchased Bike`)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5)
```

We can see those who purchased bikes have higher incomes on average. Next, I plotted age brackets versus average income:

```{r}
bikes %>%
 mutate(Income = as.numeric(gsub("[$|,]", "", Income))) %>%
 group_by(`Age Brackets`) %>%
 summarize(avg_income = mean(Income)) %>%
 ggplot(aes(`Age Brackets`, avg_income, color = `Age Brackets`)) +
 geom_col()
```

This shows income tends to increase up through middle age then declines in retirement ages.

There are still many additional relationships to analyze in this data - occupation types, regions, commute distance and other factors that may influence bike purchasing. But this initial analysis has provided me with some useful insights.
